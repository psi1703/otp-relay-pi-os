# OTP Relay Portal — Update Pipeline Guide

---

## What this guide covers

This document explains:

- how the Raspberry Pi self-hosted GitHub Actions runner is used
- how each update lane is separated to reduce deployment risk
- what files trigger each workflow
- what each deployment script is allowed to change
- how server config updates differ from UI and application code updates
- how nginx, systemd, and shell-script updates are applied safely
- what sudo access is required for the server-config workflow
- how to troubleshoot common deployment failures

---

# 1. Architecture

The project has **four deployment lanes**:

1. **Application code deploy**
2. **Portal UI deploy**
3. **Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide deploy**
4. **Server config deploy**

This split exists so that changes in one area do **not** unintentionally redeploy or overwrite unrelated parts of the system.

---

# 2. Deployment model

## 2.1 GitHub repo — source of truth

The GitHub repo stores:

- backend runtime files such as `main.py` and `monitor.py`
- portal UI files such as `frontend/app.jsx`, `frontend/index.html`, and `frontend/style.css`
- Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide source files under `docs/help/`
- server-managed files such as:
  - `install.sh`
  - `update.sh`
  - `deploy_users.sh`
  - `systemd/*.service`
  - `nginx/otp-relay.conf.template`
- deployment workflows under `.github/workflows/`
- deployment scripts under `scripts/`

## 2.2 GitHub Actions runner on the Pi

The self-hosted runner:

- checks out the repo into its temporary workspace
- runs only the workflow triggered by the changed file paths
- applies a narrow deploy script for that update lane

Typical runner workspace:

```bash
~/actions-runner/_work/otp-relay-pi-os/otp-relay-pi-os/
```

## 2.3 Live deployment target

The live application is served from:

```bash
/opt/otp-relay
```

Deployment scripts copy from the runner workspace into `/opt/otp-relay`, or into server-managed locations such as:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/
/etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

---

# 3. Final operating model

The current recommended workflow is:

1. Edit files in the GitHub repo.
2. Push to `main`.
3. GitHub Actions runs on the self-hosted Pi runner.
4. Only the matching workflow is triggered.
5. Only the allowed files for that workflow are updated on the server.

Normal updates should **not** require manually SSHing into the Pi to copy files. See [Operational rules](#16-operational-rules).

Key Pi locations:

```bash
~/actions-runner
/opt/otp-relay
/etc/systemd/system
/etc/nginx/sites-available
```

---

# 4. Update lanes

## 4.1 Application code deploy

### Workflow

```bash
.github/workflows/deploy-application-code.yml
```

### Triggered by changes to

```text
main.py
monitor.py
scripts/deploy_application_code.py
.github/workflows/deploy-application-code.yml
```

### Deployment script

```bash
scripts/deploy_application_code.py
```

### What it does

- validates Python files before deployment
- compares repo files against live files in `/opt/otp-relay`
- copies only changed files
- restarts only the affected services

### What it does **not** manage

- UI files
- Help Docs
- nginx config
- systemd unit files
- shell installers or maintenance scripts

This lane is intentionally narrow and is only for runtime Python code.

---

## 4.2 Portal UI deploy

### Workflow

```bash
.github/workflows/deploy-portal-ui.yml
```

### Triggered by changes to

```text
frontend/app.jsx
frontend/index.html
frontend/style.css
scripts/deploy_portal_ui.py
.github/workflows/deploy-portal-ui.yml
```

### Deployment script

```bash
scripts/deploy_portal_ui.py
```

### What it does

- compares repo UI files against live files in `/opt/otp-relay/frontend`
- copies only changed UI files
- does **not** restart backend services

### Why this split exists

Small UI fixes should not redeploy backend code, touch system services, or modify infrastructure files.

---

## 4.3 Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide deploy

### Workflow

```bash
.github/workflows/deploy-help-docs.yml
```

### Triggered by changes to

```text
docs/help/**
scripts/build_help_docs.py
.github/workflows/deploy-help-docs.yml
```

### What it manages

- source markdown pages in `docs/help/`
- screenshot and image assets in `docs/help/assets/`
- the Help Docs / wizard-guide build script
- generated `frontend/help/` output
- generated `frontend/help/wizard-guide.json` consumed by the RTA Wizard floating guide
- generated `frontend/help/manifest.json` and `frontend/help/rendered/*.html` for optional reference/fallback Help pages
- deployed Help Docs and wizard-guide assets under `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/`

### What maintainers do

Maintainers edit only the repo source files and push to `main`:

```text
docs/help/*.md
docs/help/assets/*
```

The Pi self-hosted runner automatically checks out the repo, runs `python3 scripts/build_help_docs.py`, and syncs the generated `frontend/help/` output into `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/`.

No maintainer should manually edit `frontend/help/` or `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/` for normal Help Docs / wizard-guide updates.

For the full build and deployment flow, wizard block syntax, step IDs, screenshot rules, and permission repair, see [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Important rule

The RTA Wizard floating guide is markdown-driven. User-facing guide text should be maintained in `docs/help/*.md` using explicit wizard step blocks, and screenshots should be maintained in `docs/help/assets/`. The generated `frontend/help/wizard-guide.json` is build output and should not be hand-edited.

---

## 4.4 Server config deploy

### Workflow

```bash
.github/workflows/deploy-server-config.yml
```

### Triggered by changes to

```text
install.sh
update.sh
deploy_users.sh
systemd/*.service
nginx/otp-relay.conf.template
scripts/deploy_server_config.py
.github/workflows/deploy-server-config.yml
```

### Deployment script

```bash
scripts/deploy_server_config.py
```

### What it manages

- shell scripts copied into `/opt/otp-relay`
- systemd unit files copied into `/etc/systemd/system/`
- nginx template copied into `/opt/otp-relay/nginx/`
- rendered live nginx config written to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/otp-relay`

### What makes this lane different

This workflow touches **root-managed server files**, so it requires carefully limited `sudo` access for the GitHub runner user. See [Sudo model](#9-sudo-model-for-server-config-deploy).

---

# 5. Why the deployment is split

The deployment lanes are separated for safety.

Without this split:

- a UI change could accidentally restart backend services
- a Python code change could accidentally overwrite nginx or systemd config
- a docs update could accidentally affect the running portal
- infrastructure updates could be mixed with routine UI work

The intended model is:

- **app code** updates only app code
- **UI** updates only UI
- **Help Docs** updates only docs output
- **server config** updates only server-managed files

---

# 6. Server config deployment behavior

The server-config pipeline should use **incremental exact updates**, not a broad full-server refresh.

## 6.1 Shell scripts

Managed files:

```text
install.sh
update.sh
deploy_users.sh
```

Behavior:

- validate each script with `bash -n`
- copy only changed files into `/opt/otp-relay`
- preserve executable permissions
- do **not** restart services unless some other changed file requires it

## 6.2 systemd unit files

Managed files:

```text
systemd/otp-relay.service
systemd/otp-monitor.service
```

Behavior:

- copy changed unit files into `/etc/systemd/system/`
- run `systemctl daemon-reload`
- restart only the services whose unit files changed
- verify the restarted services are active

## 6.3 nginx template

Managed file:

```text
nginx/otp-relay.conf.template
```

Behavior:

- copy the template into `/opt/otp-relay/nginx/otp-relay.conf.template`
- source `/opt/otp-relay/.env`
- read `SERVER_HOSTNAME` and `SERVER_IP`
- render the live nginx config with `envsubst`
- write the rendered config to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/otp-relay`
- run `nginx -t`
- reload nginx only if validation succeeds

---

# 7. Why the nginx template is deployed, not a static config

The repo uses a template file:

```bash
nginx/otp-relay.conf.template
```

This template includes environment placeholders such as:

```nginx
server_name ${SERVER_HOSTNAME} ${SERVER_IP};
```

Because those values are server-specific, the deployment pipeline should not copy a pre-rendered static config from GitHub. Instead, it should:

1. deploy the template
2. load environment values from `/opt/otp-relay/.env`
3. render the live config on the server
4. validate the rendered nginx config
5. reload nginx

---

# 8. Timestamped logging

The server-config deployment script should emit timestamped logs like:

```text
[2026-04-21 14:32:01] Starting server config deployment
[2026-04-21 14:32:01] Validating shell script: /path/to/install.sh
[2026-04-21 14:32:01] RUN: bash -n /path/to/install.sh
[2026-04-21 14:32:02] Changed service files:
[2026-04-21 14:32:02]  - systemd/otp-relay.service
[2026-04-21 14:32:02] RUN: sudo -n /usr/bin/systemctl daemon-reload
[2026-04-21 14:32:03] Service is active: otp-relay.service
[2026-04-21 14:32:03] Server config deployment completed successfully
```

This makes Actions logs easier to debug and confirms the exact order of operations.

<a id="server-config-sudoers"></a>

# 9. Sudo model for server-config deploy

The service account `otprelay` exists to **run** the OTP Relay service, not to manage system infrastructure.

The GitHub runner user (for example `initbox`) must have limited `sudo` permission for the exact commands the server-config workflow uses.

## Recommended sudoers entries

```sudoers
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart otp-relay.service
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart otp-monitor.service
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl is-active --quiet otp-relay.service
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl is-active --quiet otp-monitor.service
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl daemon-reload
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl reload nginx
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nginx -t
initbox ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/install
```

## Important rule

The deployment script should call the **exact same command paths** as the sudoers entries.

For example, if sudoers allows:

```sudoers
/usr/bin/systemctl restart otp-relay.service
```

then the script should call:

```bash
sudo -n /usr/bin/systemctl restart otp-relay.service
```

not a generic `sudo systemctl ...` or `/bin/systemctl ...`.

---

# 10. File and command ownership model

## Service runtime account

The `install.sh` process creates the `otprelay` system user. That user runs the portal service with limited privileges.

## Runner account

The self-hosted GitHub Actions runner account (`initbox`) is responsible for deployment automation. On the Pi all files under `/opt/otp-relay` are owned by `root` — the runner uses `sudo` for root-managed targets and writes directly to paths it has been given ownership of (primarily `frontend/help/`).

For permission repair commands when runner write access needs to be restored, see [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md — Permissions required for runner deployment](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md#12-permissions-required-for-runner-deployment).

## Root-managed targets

The following areas remain root-managed:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/
/etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

That is why the server-config deploy must use tightly scoped sudo permissions.

---

# 11. Where files live

## Repo source

```bash
main.py
monitor.py
frontend/
docs/help/
systemd/
nginx/
scripts/
.github/workflows/
```

## Runner workspace

```bash
~/actions-runner/_work/otp-relay-pi-os/otp-relay-pi-os/
```

## Live app

```bash
/opt/otp-relay
```

## Root-managed live config

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/
/etc/nginx/sites-available/
```

# 12. Workflow summary

## Application code workflow

- validates Python files
- copies changed `main.py` / `monitor.py`
- restarts only affected services

## Portal UI workflow

- copies only allowed UI files
- no service restart

## Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide workflow

- runs automatically when `docs/help/**`, `scripts/build_help_docs.py`, or the Help Docs workflow changes
- rebuilds optional rendered Help pages
- rebuilds `frontend/help/wizard-guide.json` for the RTA Wizard floating guide
- copies `docs/help/assets/` into generated `frontend/help/assets/`
- syncs generated `frontend/help/` output to the live portal

See [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full build and deployment flow.

## Server config workflow

- validates shell scripts
- copies changed server-managed files
- reloads systemd when needed
- validates and reloads nginx when needed
- restarts only services affected by changed unit files

---

# 13. Day-to-day usage

## Update backend runtime code

Edit `main.py` or `monitor.py` and push to `main`.

## Update portal UI

Edit `frontend/app.jsx`, `frontend/index.html`, or `frontend/style.css` and push to `main`.

## Update Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide content

Edit markdown guide content in `docs/help/*.md` and add or replace screenshots in `docs/help/assets/`. Push to `main`.

The Pi runner automatically checks out the repo, runs the build script, and syncs the output to `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/`. Manual deployment is only needed for emergency or debug work — normal maintainers should not SSH into the Pi to rebuild or copy Help Docs files.

For wizard block syntax, step IDs, screenshot rules, and local build checks, see [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Update server-managed files

Edit `install.sh`, `update.sh`, `deploy_users.sh`, `systemd/*.service`, or `nginx/otp-relay.conf.template` and push to `main`.

For day-to-day server operations (service status, restarts, user list updates), see [README — Day-to-Day Operations](./README.md#day-to-day-operations).

# 14. Manual verification commands on the Pi

## Check runner workspace

```bash
ls -R ~/actions-runner/_work/otp-relay-pi-os/otp-relay-pi-os
```

## Check live app files

```bash
ls -R /opt/otp-relay
```

## Check live systemd units

```bash
ls -l /etc/systemd/system/otp-*.service
systemctl status otp-relay.service
systemctl status otp-monitor.service
```

## Check rendered nginx config

```bash
sudo cat /etc/nginx/sites-available/otp-relay
sudo nginx -t
```

## Check frontend and guide endpoints

See [README — Post-install verification](./README.md#post-install-verification) for the full curl verification block.

## Check Actions logs for timestamped deployment output

Open the relevant workflow run in GitHub Actions and inspect the deployment step.

---

# 15. Troubleshooting

## Problem: workflow ran but nothing changed

Check:

- whether the changed file path actually matches the workflow `paths:` filter
- whether the correct workflow triggered
- whether the deployment script found any file differences

## Problem: workflow cannot find the deployment script

Cause: the workflow refers to a filename that does not exist on `main`.

Fix: ensure the workflow path and the committed script filename match exactly.

## Problem: `sudo: a terminal is required` or `a password is required`

Cause: the runner user lacks `NOPASSWD` sudo permission for one of the required commands.

Fix: add exact sudoers entries for the exact command paths — see [Section 9](#9-sudo-model-for-server-config-deploy).

## Problem: `systemctl` restart works manually but fails in Actions

Cause: sudoers allows one exact path, but the script uses another.

Fix: align the script command path exactly with sudoers, for example `/usr/bin/systemctl`.

## Problem: nginx reload fails

Check whether `/opt/otp-relay/.env` contains `SERVER_HOSTNAME` and `SERVER_IP`, whether the rendered config is valid, and whether `nginx -t` passes before reload.

## Problem: service becomes inactive after deployment

Check:

```bash
systemctl status otp-relay.service
systemctl status otp-monitor.service
journalctl -u otp-relay.service -n 100
journalctl -u otp-monitor.service -n 100
```

## Problem: Help Docs or UI changed but backend also restarted

That indicates the wrong workflow or wrong deployment script was used. The intended model is lane separation.

## Problem: RTA Wizard guide text did not update after editing markdown

Check:

- the edited file is under `docs/help/`
- the markdown uses the correct wizard step block, for example `<!-- wizard:password_reset -->`
- the workflow `deploy-help-docs.yml` triggered after the push to `main`
- the Actions log shows `python3 scripts/build_help_docs.py` completed successfully
- `frontend/help/wizard-guide.json` was generated in the runner workspace
- `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/wizard-guide.json` exists on the Pi
- the browser is not showing cached portal data

See also [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md — Troubleshooting](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md#13-troubleshooting).

Verify from the Pi:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/help/wizard-guide.json | python3 -m json.tool >/dev/null
```

## Problem: wizard screenshots did not update

Check:

- the screenshot was committed under `docs/help/assets/`
- the markdown references the image with `assets/<filename>`
- the build copied it to `frontend/help/assets/`
- the workflow synced it to `/opt/otp-relay/frontend/help/assets/`
- the public path returns HTTP 200:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "asset=%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:8000/help/assets/<filename>
```

## Problem: runner shows Offline in GitHub

See [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md — Troubleshooting](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md#13-troubleshooting) for runner service check and restart commands.

---

# 16. Operational rules

- GitHub repo is the source of truth.
- Runner workspace is temporary build space.
- `/opt/otp-relay` is the live application path — do not treat it as a git working copy.
- `/etc/systemd/system/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` are root-managed targets.
- Use separate workflows for app code, UI, docs, and server config.
- Do not use a broad full update process for routine incremental changes.
- Keep deployment scripts narrow and allowlist-based.
- Keep timestamped logs in server-config deployment output.

---

# 17. Summary

This project supports a safer multi-lane update pipeline:

- **Application code deploy** for Python runtime files
- **Portal UI deploy** for frontend files
- **Help Docs / RTA Wizard guide deploy** for markdown guide content, screenshots, and generated wizard-guide JSON — see [HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./HELP-DOCS-DEPLOYMENT.md)
- **Server config deploy** for shell scripts, systemd units, and nginx template updates — sudo requirements in [Section 9](#9-sudo-model-for-server-config-deploy)

The core principle is simple:

**Edit in GitHub → matching workflow runs on the Pi → only the intended part of the system is updated.**

For Help Docs and RTA Wizard guide content, maintainers edit only `docs/help/*.md` and `docs/help/assets/`. The self-hosted runner handles the build and live sync automatically.
